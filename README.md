- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cashier58
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing piano and reading fiction. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming languages such as java, python, js and their frameworks. In addition, I not only practice my English skills but also learn about a new language, Japanese. This is because Japanese people are extremely disciplined, I can learn from them and it is useful in my major. If i have a chance, I will try to learn another language, Chinese, for example.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me by linkedin or facebook.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Thu Ngan.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I really like to be alone in another corner in order to chill with my thinking.
